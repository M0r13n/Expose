	abstract = {Background
Compared to traditional persuasive technology and health games, gamification is posited to offer several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being, and increasingly used. Yet little is known about its effectiveness.

Aims
We aimed to assess the amount and quality of empirical support for the advantages and effectiveness of gamification applied to health and well-being.

Methods
We identified seven potential advantages of gamification from existing research and conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies on gamification for health and well-being, assessing quality of evidence, effect type, and application domain.

Results
We identified 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and well-being. 59\% reported positive, 41\% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes.

Conclusions
The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. However several studies report mixed or neutral effect. Findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations of many studies (e.g., a lack of comparison of gamified interventions to non-gamified versions of the intervention).},

The intention of this classification is to guide people through the vast field of Serious Games by providing them with a general overview. For example, it may appeal to teachers who wish to find games with strong educational potential though they may be outside the “edugames” field. This chapter will start by discussing the definition of Serious Games, and define them as having a combination of “serious” and “game” aspects. This theoretical framework will be used to review previous classification systems and discuss their limitations. It will then introduce a new classification that addresses a number of these limitations: the G/P/S model. This classifies games according to both their “serious-related” and “game-related” characteristics, and combines the strengths of several previous classification systems.},

Um diesen Vorgang zu beschleunigen, wird nach neuen Möglichkeiten gesucht, um Anreize für Forschende zu schaffen sich mit der Thematik Open Access zu befassen und die Prinzipien auch in der Praxis umzusetzen. Ein solches Konzept zum Schaffen von Anreizen, welches sich bereits in unterschiedlichsten Kontexten bewährt hat, ist Gamification. In einer Studie mit 28 Teilnehmenden wurde die Wirkung der Spielelemente Abzeichen und Fortschrittsanzeige auf die Motivation beim Bearbeiten eines Online-Quiz zum Thema Open Access untersucht. Beide Spielelemente lieferten einen statistisch signifikanten Anstieg bei der Anzahl an bearbeiteten Fragen in Vergleich zu einer Kontrollgruppe. Dieses Ergebnis lässt darauf schließen, dass Gamification ein hilfreiches Instrument ist, um Wissenschaftler/innen für das Thema Open Access zu motivieren.},

	abstract = {Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.},

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

In this paper, we propose a new definition for gamification, which emphases the experiential nature of games and gamification, instead of the systemic understanding. Furthermore, we tie this definition to theory from service marketing because majority of gamification implementations aim towards goals of marketing, which brings to the discussion the notion of how customer / user is always ultimately the creator of value. Since now, the main venue for academic discussion on gamification has mainly been the HCI community. We find it relevant both for industry practitioners as well as for academics to study how gamification can fit in the body of knowledge of existing service literature because the goals and the means of gamification and marketing have a significant overlap.},

This study focuses on the influence of gamification on students’ motivation in using e-learning applications based on the ARCS+G model. Data from the Instructional Materials Motivation Scale used, were gathered and analysed for comparison of two groups (one control and one experimental) in attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction categories. Based on analysis of the result, students from the experimental group are more motivated to use e-learning applications compared with the controlled group.

This field of research is called gamification and represents the use of game elements (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) in a field (education, marketing etc.) that is not a computer game. A review of literature related to the field of teaching with online courses in information technology (e.g. programming, software engineering) shows that the topic of gamification has so far been inadequately explored, with the lack of theoretical and empirical research that would involve gamification methodology. Previous studies have shown that gamification can have a positive impact on the pedagogical and psychological aspects of e-learning. In this paper empirical research is presented regarding the use of gamification in online teaching of programming. A gamified e-course was designed for the lectures in programming, and a possible positive effect was examined on the usage of learning materials in an experimental group of students who will use a gamified e-course (online system).},

	abstract = {Gamification is the usage of game mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics and game thinking in non-game systems. Its main objective is to increase user’s motivation, experience and engagement. For the same reason, it has started to penetrate in e-learning systems. However, when using gamified design elements in e-learning, we must consider various types of learners. In the phases of analysis and design of such elements, the cooperation of education, technology, pedagogy, design and finance experts is required. This paper discusses the development phases of introducing gamification into e-learning systems, various gamification design elements and their suitability for usage in e-learning systems. Several gamified design elements are found suited for e-learning (including points, badges, trophies, customization, leader boards, levels, progress tracking, challenges, feedback, social engagement loops and the freedom to fail). Advices for the usage of each of those elements in e-learning systems are also provided in this study. Based on those advises and the identified phases of introducing gamification info e-learning systems, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the effectiveness of gamification of an informatics online course. Results showed that students enrolled in the gamified version of the online module achieved greater learning success. Positive results encourage us to investigate the gamification of online learning content for other topics and courses. We also encourage more research on the influence of specific gamified design elements on learner’s motivation and engagement.},
