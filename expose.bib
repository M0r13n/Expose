	abstract = {Background
Compared to traditional persuasive technology and health games, gamification is posited to offer several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being, and increasingly used. Yet little is known about its effectiveness.

Aims
We aimed to assess the amount and quality of empirical support for the advantages and effectiveness of gamification applied to health and well-being.

Methods
We identified seven potential advantages of gamification from existing research and conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies on gamification for health and well-being, assessing quality of evidence, effect type, and application domain.

Results
We identified 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and well-being. 59\% reported positive, 41\% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes.

Conclusions
The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. However several studies report mixed or neutral effect. Findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations of many studies (e.g., a lack of comparison of gamified interventions to non-gamified versions of the intervention).},

The intention of this classification is to guide people through the vast field of Serious Games by providing them with a general overview. For example, it may appeal to teachers who wish to find games with strong educational potential though they may be outside the “edugames” field. This chapter will start by discussing the definition of Serious Games, and define them as having a combination of “serious” and “game” aspects. This theoretical framework will be used to review previous classification systems and discuss their limitations. It will then introduce a new classification that addresses a number of these limitations: the G/P/S model. This classifies games according to both their “serious-related” and “game-related” characteristics, and combines the strengths of several previous classification systems.},

Um diesen Vorgang zu beschleunigen, wird nach neuen Möglichkeiten gesucht, um Anreize für Forschende zu schaffen sich mit der Thematik Open Access zu befassen und die Prinzipien auch in der Praxis umzusetzen. Ein solches Konzept zum Schaffen von Anreizen, welches sich bereits in unterschiedlichsten Kontexten bewährt hat, ist Gamification. In einer Studie mit 28 Teilnehmenden wurde die Wirkung der Spielelemente Abzeichen und Fortschrittsanzeige auf die Motivation beim Bearbeiten eines Online-Quiz zum Thema Open Access untersucht. Beide Spielelemente lieferten einen statistisch signifikanten Anstieg bei der Anzahl an bearbeiteten Fragen in Vergleich zu einer Kontrollgruppe. Dieses Ergebnis lässt darauf schließen, dass Gamification ein hilfreiches Instrument ist, um Wissenschaftler/innen für das Thema Open Access zu motivieren.},

Popular discussion connects gamification to increased user engagement, service profitability, goal commitment and the overall betterment of various behavioral outcomes. However, there is still an absence of a coherent and ample body of empirical evidence that would confirm such expectations. To this end, this paper reports the results of a 2 year (1+1 year – between-group) field experiment in gamifying a service by implementing a game mechanic called ‘badges’. During the experiment a pre-implementation group (N=1410) was monitored for 1 year. After the implementation, the post-implementation (the gamified condition) group (N=1579) was monitored for another full year. Results show that users in the gamified condition were significantly more likely to post trade proposals, carry out transactions, comment on proposals and generally use the service in a more active way.},

To gain more detailed knowledge about the effect of game design elements in non-game contexts, the impact of individual elements should be considered more closely. Also, the interactive experience of using augmented reality in real-world environment is being explored increasingly in a range of commercial environments. This article is about an experimental study (N=80) which investigates the effects of two game design elements (badges and leaderboards) in an augmented reality supported warehouse setting, on user's motivation and task completion time. The implementation of the leaderboard significantly increased performance, but both game design elements generate mixed results about the influence on motivation. The results show that gamification can help to make working in warehouses more interesting and possibly more efficient. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that the use of game design elements can have negative side effects.},

This online experiment examined the effects of three commonly employed game design elements -- points, leaderboard, levels -- on users' performance, intrinsic motivation, perceived autonomy and competence in an image annotation task. Implementation of these game elements significantly increased performance, but did not affect perceived autonomy, competence or intrinsic motivation. Our findings suggest that points, levels and leaderboards by themselves neither make nor break users' intrinsic motivation in non-game contexts. Instead, it is assumed that they act as progress indicators, guiding and enhancing user performance. While more research on the contextual factors that may potentially mediate the effects of game elements on intrinsic motivation is required, it seems that the implementation of points, levels, and leaderboards is a viable means to promote specific user behavior in non-game contexts.},

	abstract = {Courses in virtual learning environments can leave recently enrolled participants in a state of loneliness, confusion and boredom. . What course content is essential in the course, where can more information be found and which assignments are mandatory? Research has stated that learner control and motivation are crucial issues for successful online education. This paper presents and discusses visualisation as a channel to improve learner’s control and understanding of programming concepts and gamification as a way to increase study motivation in virtual learning environments. Data has been collected by evaluation questionnaires and group discussions in two courses partly given in the Moodle virtual learning environment. One course is on Game based learning for Bachelor’s programmes, the other is a course on e-learning for university teachers. Both the courses have used progress bars to visualise students’ study paths and digital badges for gamification. Results have also been discussed with teachers and pedagogues at a department for computer and systems sciences. Furthermore, two visualisation prototypes have been designed, developed and evaluated in programming lectures. Findings indicate that visualisation by progress bars is a good way to improve course participants’ overview in online environments with rich and multifaceted content. To what degree the visualisation facilitates the course completion is hard to estimate, and like students have different learning styles, they also seem to have different visualisation needs. Gamification by digital badges seems to have various motivational impacts in different study groups and in traditional university programmes the traditional grades seem to be the main carrots. Finally, it seems that software visualisation might be a promising path to enhance programming education in the 21st century.},

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

Furthermore, we tie this definition to theory from service marketing because majority of gamification implementations aim towards goals of marketing, which brings to the discussion the notion of how customer / user is always ultimately the creator of value. Since now, the main venue for academic discussion on gamification has mainly been the HCI community.

This field of research is called gamification and represents the use of game elements (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) in a field (education, marketing etc.) that is not a computer game. A review of literature related to the field of teaching with online courses in information technology (e.g. programming, software engineering) shows that the topic of gamification has so far been inadequately explored, with the lack of theoretical and empirical research that would involve gamification methodology. Previous studies have shown that gamification can have a positive impact on the pedagogical and psychological aspects of e-learning. In this paper empirical research is presented regarding the use of gamification in online teaching of programming. A gamified e-course was designed for the lectures in programming, and a possible positive effect was examined on the usage of learning materials in an experimental group of students who will use a gamified e-course (online system).},

For the same reason, it has started to penetrate in e-learning systems. However, when using gamified design elements in e-learning, we must consider various types of learners. In the phases of analysis and design of such elements, the cooperation of education, technology, pedagogy, design and finance experts is required. This paper discusses the development phases of introducing gamification into e-learning systems, various gamification design elements and their suitability for usage in e-learning systems. Several gamified design elements are found suited for e-learning (including points, badges, trophies, customization, leader boards, levels, progress tracking, challenges, feedback, social engagement loops and the freedom to fail). Advices for the usage of each of those elements in e-learning systems are also provided in this study. Based on those advises and the identified phases of introducing gamification info e-learning systems, we conducted an experimental study to investigate the effectiveness of gamification of an informatics online course. Results showed that students enrolled in the gamified version of the online module achieved greater learning success. Positive results encourage us to investigate the gamification of online learning content for other topics and courses. We also encourage more research on the influence of specific gamified design elements on learner’s motivation and engagement.},

A badge is typically a graphical icon that appears as a reward for the user after reaching an achievement but that has no practical value. In this study, we describe and evaluate the use of achievement badges in the TRAKLA2 online learning environment where students solve interactive, automatically assessed exercises in a Data Structures and Algorithms course throughout the semester. We conducted an experiment where the students (N=281) were randomly divided into a treatment and a control group, with and without achievement badges. Students in the treatment group were awarded achievement badges, for example, for solving exercises correctly on the first attempt, doing exercises early, or solving all the exercises in a round with full points. Grading was the same for both groups, i.e. collecting badges did not affect the final grade, even though the exercise points themselves did. Students’ activity in TRAKLA2 was logged in order to find out whether the achievement badges had an effect on their behavior. We also collected numerical and open-ended feedback in order to find out students’ attitudes towards the badges. Our results show that achievement badges can be used to affect students’ behavior. Statistically significant differences were observed in the time used per exercise, number of sessions, total time, and normalized total number of badges. Furthermore, the majority of the students reported being motivated by the badges. Based on our findings, achievement badges seem to be a promising method to motivate students and to encourage desired study practices.},

	abstract = {Today, our reality and lives are increasingly game-like, not only because games have become a pervasive part of our lives, but also because activities, systems and services are increasingly gamified. Gamification refers to designing information systems to afford similar experiences and motivations as games do, and consequently, attempting to affect user behavior. In recent years, popularity of gamification has skyrocketed and manifested in growing numbers of gamified applications, as well as a rapidly increasing amount of research. However, this vein of research has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance or a clear picture of the field. To make the picture more coherent, we provide a comprehensive review of the gamification research (N = 819 studies) and analyze the research models and results in empirical studies on gamification. While the results in general lean towards positive findings about the effectiveness of gamification, the amount of mixed results is remarkable. Furthermore, education, health and crowdsourcing as well as points, badges and leaderboards persist as the most common contexts and ways of implementing gamification. Concurrently, gamification research still lacks coherence in research models, and a consistency in the variables and theoretical foundations. As a final contribution of the review, we provide a comprehensive discussion, consisting of 15 future research trajectories, on future agenda for the growing vein of literature on gamification and gameful systems within the information system science field.},

	abstract = {Background
Gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, has become a popular technique to improve instructional outcomes in both organizational and educational contexts. In the organizational context, the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model [TETEM] provides a framework to understand how technologies, like gamification, can effect change in various instructional outcomes. Specifically, application of TETEM suggests that gamification may not effect change in instructional outcomes when learner attitudes towards game-based learning and experience with video games are low.
Method
In this study, we test this model in the gamification context by assigning potential learners to read scenarios describing gamified instruction or traditional, PowerPoint instruction in a random order and assessing their training valence.
Results
On average, participants anticipated greater value from gamified instruction, but as predicted by TETEM, this effect was moderated by both video game experience and attitudes towards game-based learning. Among potential learners with high experience and attitudes, gamification produces better outcomes than PowerPoint, but among potential learners with low experience and attitudes, gamification produces worse outcomes than PowerPoint.
Implications
We provide empirical support for TETEM and conclude that for gamification to be successful, the attitudes and experience of participants must be assessed and ensured before gamification is implemented.},
