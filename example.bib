	abstract = {Background
Compared to traditional persuasive technology and health games, gamification is posited to offer several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being, and increasingly used. Yet little is known about its effectiveness.

Aims
We aimed to assess the amount and quality of empirical support for the advantages and effectiveness of gamification applied to health and well-being.

Methods
We identified seven potential advantages of gamification from existing research and conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies on gamification for health and well-being, assessing quality of evidence, effect type, and application domain.

Results
We identified 19 papers that report empirical evidence on the effect of gamification on health and well-being. 59\% reported positive, 41\% mixed effects, with mostly moderate or lower quality of evidence provided. Results were clear for health-related behaviours, but mixed for cognitive outcomes.

Conclusions
The current state of evidence supports that gamification can have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. However several studies report mixed or neutral effect. Findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies and methodological limitations of many studies (e.g., a lack of comparison of gamified interventions to non-gamified versions of the intervention).},

It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students' engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.},

The intention of this classification is to guide people through the vast field of Serious Games by providing them with a general overview. For example, it may appeal to teachers who wish to find games with strong educational potential though they may be outside the “edugames” field. This chapter will start by discussing the definition of Serious Games, and define them as having a combination of “serious” and “game” aspects. This theoretical framework will be used to review previous classification systems and discuss their limitations. It will then introduce a new classification that addresses a number of these limitations: the G/P/S model. This classifies games according to both their “serious-related” and “game-related” characteristics, and combines the strengths of several previous classification systems.},

	abstract = {Obwohl den meisten Wissenschaftler/innen bekannt ist, dass es neben dem traditionellen und abonnementbasierten Publikationsmodell, auch die Möglichkeit existiert, ihre Forschung Open Access zu publizieren und Wissenschaftler/innen dieses neue Modell laut verschiedenen Umfragen überwiegend befürworten, findet die Transformation zu Open Access bisher nur sehr langsam statt. Um diesen Vorgang zu beschleunigen, wird nach neuen Möglichkeiten gesucht, um Anreize für Forschende zu schaffen sich mit der Thematik Open Access zu befassen und die Prinzipien auch in der Praxis umzusetzen. Ein solches Konzept zum Schaffen von Anreizen, welches sich bereits in unterschiedlichsten Kontexten bewährt hat, ist Gamification. In einer Studie mit 28 Teilnehmenden wurde die Wirkung der Spielelemente Abzeichen und Fortschrittsanzeige auf die Motivation beim Bearbeiten eines Online-Quiz zum Thema Open Access untersucht. Beide Spielelemente lieferten einen statistisch signifikanten Anstieg bei der Anzahl an bearbeiteten Fragen in Vergleich zu einer Kontrollgruppe. Dieses Ergebnis lässt darauf schließen, dass Gamification ein hilfreiches Instrument ist, um Wissenschaftler/innen für das Thema Open Access zu motivieren.},
